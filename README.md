# dotfiles

This repository contains some of my dotfiles. It is a living repository and will be updated as my needs/preferences change.

This repository primarily mirrors my `.config/` directory. The sub-directories that are not present in the `.config/` directory are:

* `tmux/`
* `vim/`

# Overview

Here's a list of the included dotfiles:

* `alacritty/alacritty.yml` - [Alacritty][Alacritty] terminal emulator configuration.
* `fish/config.fish` - [Fish][Fish] (shell) configuration.
* `leftwm/config.toml` - [LeftWM][LeftWM] tiling window manager configuration.
* `nvim/init.vim` - [Neovim][Neovim] configuration.
